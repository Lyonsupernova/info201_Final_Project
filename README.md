>The second project is “US Housing Market Trends from Zillow Data”. The contributor used R to slice and dice the data provided by Zillow to better understand the trends of the housing market. And this project is aimed at finding the trend of sales and listing price to make better investment decision. https://rpubs.com/msmirabel/zillowdata
